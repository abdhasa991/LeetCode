# My LeetCode Journey: Building DSA for Cyber Security Architecture

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on LeetCode. This series is a crucial part of my roadmap to become a highly skilled Cyber Security Architect, as I believe strong logical thinking and efficient coding are foundational for designing secure systems and understanding complex vulnerabilities.

Each solution here represents a step in strengthening my problem-solving abilities and deepening my understanding of core DSA concepts.

## My Goals and Motivation

My primary goal with this LeetCode series is to cultivate a robust understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. I'm focusing on:

* **Strengthening Logical Thinking:** Developing the ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts and devise optimal solutions.
* **Improving Code Efficiency:** Learning to write performant code with optimal time and space complexity, a critical skill for secure and scalable systems.
* **Mastering DSA Fundamentals:** Gaining deep clarity on various data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps, Stacks, Queues) and algorithmic paradigms (Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, Binary Search).
* **Preparing for Technical Interviews:** Building confidence and proficiency for the coding rounds of top-tier international companies.

As an aspiring Cyber Security Architect, I believe a strong DSA background is indispensable. It enhances my ability to:
* Identify and understand complex vulnerabilities in software.
* Design efficient and secure algorithms for cryptographic operations or security protocols.
* Optimize security tools and systems for performance.
* Approach threat modeling with a structured, logical mindset.

* ## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by DSA topics, mirroring a typical structured learning path. Each folder contains solutions to problems related to that specific data structure or algorithmic paradigm.

* **`/Arrays_and_Strings`**: Fundamental data manipulation.
* **`/Hashing`**: Efficient lookup and counting.
* **`/Linked_Lists`**: Dynamic data structures and pointer manipulation.
* **`/Stacks_and_Queues`**: LIFO/FIFO principles and their applications.
* **`/Trees_and_Graphs`**: Hierarchical and networked data representation.
* **`/Heaps`**: Priority queues and selection problems.
* **`/Greedy_Algorithms`**: Making locally optimal choices.
* **`/Binary_Search`**: Efficient searching on sorted data and solution spaces.
* **`/Backtracking`**: Exhaustive search via recursion.
* **`/Dynamic_Programming`**: Solving complex problems by breaking them into subproblems.
* **`/Advanced_Topics`**: Bit Manipulation, Tries, Intervals, Dijkstra's, etc.

* ### Inside Each Problem Folder

For each LeetCode problem, I strive to include:

* **`solution.<ext>`**: My implemented solution in Python (or other languages as I explore).
* **`README.md`**:
    * **Problem Link**: Direct link to the LeetCode problem.
    * **Problem Description (brief)**: A quick summary of the problem.
    * **Approach(es)**: A detailed explanation of my thought process, including any initial brute-force ideas and how I optimized them.
    * **Time Complexity**: Analysis of the solution's time efficiency.
    * **Space Complexity**: Analysis of the solution's space efficiency.
    * **Edge Cases/Considerations**: Any specific conditions or constraints I had to account for.
 
    * ## My Learning Process & Tools

I'm committed to a consistent learning schedule, dedicating daily time to understanding and solving these problems.

* **Platform:** LeetCode
* **Primary Language:** Java (initially, expanding to others as needed Like Python)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub for tracking progress and documentation.
* **Consistency:** Aiming for daily practice to build intuition and maintain momentum.
* **Focus:** Not just on passing test cases, but deeply understanding the underlying algorithms and data structures, and optimizing for efficiency.
